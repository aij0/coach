    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive timeline/dashboard. The primary structure is a vertical, filterable list of all 17 weeks, presented as accordion cards. This was chosen because a curriculum is inherently sequential, and this structure allows an instructor to get a quick overview of the entire semester while also being able to drill down into a specific week's details without leaving the page. A search/filter function adds a layer of non-linear exploration, allowing users to quickly find specific techniques or games. A top-level dashboard with a chart provides a high-level summary of the curriculum's focus, answering the question "What are we emphasizing this semester?" at a glance. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Weekly Themes -> Goal: Show curriculum balance -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover to see details -> Justification: Provides a quick, visual summary of the positional and conceptual focus of the 17-week plan. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Full Weekly Plan -> Goal: Provide detailed lesson plans -> Presentation: Accordion Cards -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse -> Justification: Prevents information overload on initial view and allows for focused reading of a single week's plan. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: All Text Content -> Goal: Allow quick lookup -> Presentation: Search Filter -> Interaction: Type to filter visible weeks -> Justification: Massively improves usability for instructors needing to find a specific topic quickly without manually scanning all 17 weeks. Method: JS.
