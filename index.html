    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive timeline/dashboard. The primary structure is a vertical, filterable list of all 17 weeks, presented as accordion cards. This was chosen because a curriculum is inherently sequential, and this structure allows an instructor to get a quick overview of the entire semester while also being able to drill down into a specific week's details without leaving the page. A search/filter function adds a layer of non-linear exploration, allowing users to quickly find specific techniques or games. A top-level dashboard with a chart provides a high-level summary of the curriculum's focus, answering the question "What are we emphasizing this semester?" at a glance. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Weekly Themes -> Goal: Show curriculum balance -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover to see details -> Justification: Provides a quick, visual summary of the positional and conceptual focus of the 17-week plan. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Full Weekly Plan -> Goal: Provide detailed lesson plans -> Presentation: Accordion Cards -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse -> Justification: Prevents information overload on initial view and allows for focused reading of a single week's plan. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: All Text Content -> Goal: Allow quick lookup -> Presentation: Search Filter -> Interaction: Type to filter visible weeks -> Justification: Massively improves usability for instructors needing to find a specific topic quickly without manually scanning all 17 weeks. Method: JS.

It is primarily a ground-based fighting style and focuses on taking one's opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks, chokeholds, or compression locks. It has its roots in jujutsu, judo and catch wrestling.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Brazilian jiu-jitsu was first developed around 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught Kodokan judo and Catch Wrestling in 1917 by either Mitsuyo Maeda, a travelling Japanese judoka, or one of Maeda's students Jacyntho Ferro. Later on the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system which they named Gracie jiu-jitsu. BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and judo, and has become one of the essential martial arts for modern mixed martial arts.</p>
